\section sIntro Introduction

The %GSLAM library is a set of C++ header files which provide basic numerics facilities:
	- @link TooN::Vector Vectors@endlink, @link TooN::Matrix matrices@endlink and @link gLinAlg etc @endlink
	- @link gDecomps Matrix decompositions@endlink
	- @link gOptimize Function optimization@endlink
	- @link gTransforms Parameterized matrices (eg transformations)@endlink 
	- @link gEquations linear equations@endlink
	- @link gFunctions Functions (eg automatic differentiation and numerical derivatives) @endlink

It provides classes for statically- (known at compile time) and dynamically-
(unknown at compile time) sized vectors and matrices and it can delegate
advanced functions (like large SVD or multiplication of large matrices) to
LAPACK and BLAS (this means you will need libblas and liblapack).


\section sUsage How to use TooN 
\ingroup gInterface
This section is arranged as a FAQ. Most answers include code fragments. Assume
<code>using namespace TooN;</code>.

 - \ref sDownload
 - \ref sStart

 	\subsection sDownload Getting the code and installing
	
	To get the code from cvs use:

	cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.savannah.nongnu.org:/cvsroot/toon co TooN

	The home page for the library with a version of this documentation is at:

	http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~er258/cvd/toon.html

	The code will work as-is, and comes with a default configuration, which
	should work on any system.

	On a unix system, <code>./configure && make install </code> will  install
	TooN to the correct place.  Note there is no code to be compiled, but the
	configure script performs some basic checks.

	On non-unix systems, e.g. Windows and embedded systems, you may wish to 
	configure the library manually. See \ref sManualConfiguration.

\subsection sStart Getting started

To begin, just in include the right file:

@code
#include <TooN/TooN.h>
@endcode

Everything lives in the <code>TooN</code> namespace.
